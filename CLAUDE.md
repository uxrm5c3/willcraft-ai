## 1. Build & Deploy

### Code lives on the dev machine, runs on the server inside Docker.

```
Dev machine (this repo) → git push → Server pulls → docker build → docker up
```

### Deploy command (RUN THIS — restart alone does NOT pick up changes)

```bash
ssh ubuntu@47.130.249.28 "cd ~/willcraft && \
  git pull && \
  docker compose build web && \
  docker compose up -d web"
```

### Why restart fails
The Docker image is **baked at build time**. `docker compose restart` reuses the existing image — your code change is not in it. You MUST rebuild.

### Cache trouble?
If old code keeps running after rebuild:
```bash
find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
find . -name '__pycache__' -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
docker compose build --no-cache web && docker compose up -d web
```

---

## 2. Test Pipeline

**Every deploy MUST end with a real end-to-end test.** Saying "deployed" without testing is a critical failure.

### Three required checks, in order:

**(a) Health check**
```bash
curl -s http://47.130.249.28:8082/api/health
# Expected: {"ok":true,"db_clients":N,"model":"...","model_cheap":"..."}
```

**(b) Send real email** (SMTP password is in server `.env` as `SMTP_PASSWORD`)
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = 'kylie.tan@alantanjb.com'
msg['To']   = 'koid5743@will.alantanjb.com'
msg['Subject'] = 'Deploy test'
msg.attach(MIMEText('test', 'plain'))
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as s:
    s.login('kylie.tan@alantanjb.com', 'ptsg glgi ebph yjed')
    s.send_message(msg)
```

**(c) Verify webhook fired**
```bash
ssh ubuntu@47.130.249.28 "sleep 15 && grep 'inbound-email' /var/log/nginx/access.log | tail -2"
# Expected: a fresh "POST /api/inbound-email HTTP/1.1" 200 line
```

If any of (a)–(c) fails, the deploy is NOT done. Don't claim success.

## 3. Server & Infrastructure

| Item             | Value                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Server host      | `ubuntu@47.130.249.28`                      |
| Container        | `willcraft-web`                             |
| Public port      | `8082`                                      |
| Repo path        | `~/willcraft`                               |
| Git branch       | `feat/client-chat`                          |
| Health endpoint  | `/api/health` (no auth)                     |
| Inbound webhook  | `/api/inbound-email` (Postmark, Basic auth) |
| DNS provider     | Cloudflare                                  |
| MX record        | `will.alantanjb.com → inbound.postmarkapp.com` priority 10 |

### Environment variables (in `~/willcraft/.env`)
- `POSTMARK_INBOUND_USER` / `POSTMARK_INBOUND_PASS` — Basic auth for webhook
- `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` — Gmail SMTP for outgoing test emails
- `INBOUND_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` — sender allowlist (empty = accept any)

---

## 4. Inbox Address Format

**Short. Easy to type. No subdomain.**

### Format
```
<first_name_5chars><ic_last4>@will.alantanjb.com
```

### Examples
| Client                | NRIC               | Inbox address                       |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| KOID BENG SUN         | 631204-07-5743     | `koid5743@will.alantanjb.com`       |
| KANAGARANY A/P APPU   | xxxxxx-xx-1265     | `kanag1265@will.alantanjb.com`      |
| PHEK YI TING          | 951030-01-5039     | `phek5039@will.alantanjb.com`       |

### Rules
- First word of full name, lowercase, letters only, **max 5 chars**
- Last 4 digits of NRIC (the sequence number after the last dash)
- Skip patronymics: `A/P`, `A/L`, `BIN`, `BINTI`, `BTE`, `BT`
- Skip titles: `MR`, `MRS`, `DR`, `DATO`, `DATUK`, `HAJI`, `HAJJAH`
- **NEVER use `inbox.` prefix.** MX is on bare domain.
- Backward compat: legacy `<slug>-<8hex>@…` still routes

Implemented in `services/inbound_address.py`.

## 4a. ⚠️ ALWAYS REFER TO THE WIZARD FIRST ⚠️

**THE WIZARD IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. CHECK IT BEFORE ASKING THE USER ANYTHING.**

This rule is repeated because it has been violated repeatedly. Before any
chat question — IC identity, executor, beneficiary, gift, address, anything —
the code MUST first query the wizard tables (`Person`, `Document`,
`Step1`, `Step2`, … `WillData`) and skip if the data is already there.

### Hard rules

1. **Never ask about an IC if the NRIC already exists on a `Person` row.**
   The chat must extract the canonical 12-digit `NNNNNN-NN-NNNN` pattern
   from the document's `extracted_data` (it may be embedded in a longer
   sentence, prefixed with `VALUE:`, etc.) and compare against
   `Person.nric_passport` — not raw string equality.

2. **Never ask about a person if the name already exists on a `Person` row.**
   Match on `full_name` case-insensitively. Issuing-authority strings
   (`KETUA PENGARAH PENDAFTARAN NEGARA`, `JABATAN PENDAFTARAN NEGARA`,
   `MyKad`, `KAD PENGENALAN`) are NOT person names — treat as empty.

3. **Never ask about a document already linked to a Person**
   (`Person.document_id == Document.id`).

4. **Never re-ask after Skip.** `_chat_skipped=True` in `extracted_data`
   means the user said skip — respect it.

5. **Step 2+ data**: before asking testator/executor/guardian/beneficiary
   questions, check the corresponding `step1`/`step2`/… JSON. If it's
   already populated, advance to the next step.

6. **Garbage-in-extracted-data is a wizard problem, not a chat problem.**
   When AI extraction returns rambling text in `nric_number` (e.g.
   `"This appears to be a longer reference number…"`), the dedup logic
   must still extract the 12-digit pattern and match. Don't push noise
   onto the user.

### The litmus test before posting any walkthrough question

```
Q: Is the answer already in the wizard?
   - YES → skip, advance, don't ask
   - NO  → ask, but show the evidence/snippet that prompts the question
```

If you find yourself writing code that asks the user something the wizard
already knows, STOP and add a dedup check first.

      ├─ OCR / extract structured data (NRIC fields, lot/title/mukim, bank details, etc.)
      ├─ Batch grouping: cluster images that belong to the same asset
      ├─ Address enrichment: match property addresses from WhatsApp text → property docs
      ├─ Post "📋 N exhibits received" intake card
      └─ Post "📨 AI Summary of your message" follow-up

## 6. The 10-Step Wizard

These steps mirror `app.py` `/wizard/step/N` routes and the chat planner stages.
**The chat walkthrough MUST follow the same definitions. Do not confuse roles between steps.**

| Step | Name                  | What it captures                                   |
|------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Identity**          | Family relationships ONLY (Spouse, Son, Daughter, Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Son-in-law, Daughter-in-law, etc.) |
| 2    | **Testator**          | Confirm testator's name, NRIC, DOB, address, occupation |
| 3    | **Executor + Substitute** | Pick from identities. Cross-reference AI Summary text |
| 4    | **Guardians**         | Only required if minor children                    |
| 5    | **Beneficiaries**     | Pick from identities. Cross-reference AI Summary text |
| 6    | **Specific Gifts**    | Match property/bank/vehicle docs → beneficiaries with shares |
| 7    | **Residuary**         | What remains goes to whom                          |
| 8    | **Trust**             | Optional — testamentary trust details              |
| 9    | **Other Provisions**  | Optional — funeral wishes, special instructions    |
| 10   | **Generate / Review** | Compile and produce the will document              |

### Critical role separation
**Identity (Step 1) is for FAMILY relationships only.**
- Daughter, Son, Sister-in-law, Spouse, etc. ✓
- ~~Executor, Witness, Trustee, Guardian, Beneficiary~~ — these are LATER steps ✗

---

## 7. Chat Flow After Email Forward

User's exact wording (PRESERVE THIS ORDER):

> **Step 1**: Receive the WhatsApp the user sends
> **Step 2**: The text/words — use AI Summary to summarise and get user feedback. Make sure the AI summary is correct and understood correctly.
> **Step 3**: Decipher the images into types (IC, title, etc.)
> **Step 4**: Identity match (follow the wizard step)

### Implementation mapping
| User's step | Implementation                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | `/api/inbound-email` saves user message + attachments           |
| 2           | `_summarise_message()` posts AI Summary card with confirmation CTA |
| 3           | `classify_file()` + `classify_batch()` in `_process_inbound_message_async` |
| 4           | Identity walkthrough triggered by "▶️ Start — verify identities" click |

---

## 8. Per-Step Behaviour Rules

### Skip-If-Already-In-Wizard (applies to ALL steps)

If the wizard already has the data, **don't ask again — skip past it.**

| Already in wizard                                | Behaviour              |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Document linked to a Person                      | Skip in Step 1         |
| IC NRIC matches existing `Person.nric_passport`  | Skip in Step 1         |
| Same name in `Person` table                      | Skip in Step 1         |
| User clicked Skip in chat (`_chat_skipped=True`) | Skip in Step 1         |
| `step1.full_name` is set                         | Skip Step 2            |
| 2 executors set                                  | Skip Step 3            |
| `step4` (beneficiaries) non-empty                | Skip Step 5            |

### Step 1 (Identity) — buttons

Show ONLY these family relationships:
```
Spouse | Son | Daughter | Father | Mother | Brother | Sister
Son-in-law | Daughter-in-law
Skip | Delete
```
**Never show** `Executor`, `Witness`, `Trustee`, `Guardian`, `Beneficiary` here.

### Skip / Yes / Delete buttons MUST work

- **Skip**: writes `_chat_skipped=True` to `Document.extracted_data`, `get_pending_ic_documents` filters it out, walkthrough advances. Verified by `_try_skip_pending_identity` in `app.py`.
- **Yes**: saves the deduced relationship, creates Person row, advances.
- **Delete**: soft-deletes the document (and any siblings with same name/NRIC), advances.
- **Buttons render only on the LATEST assistant message** so old questions don't leave stale buttons.

---

## 9. Cross-Reference AI Summary

When suggesting Executor or Beneficiary, the chat MUST show the snippet from the WhatsApp/email that names them. The user has repeated this MANY TIMES.

### Step 3 (Executor)
- Use `find_executor_candidate()` → calls `deduce_roles()` (Claude API)
- Heuristic fallback: search for "executor" near a relationship word
- Display: `📨 **Suggested:** **<name>** _from your message:_ "<snippet>"`

### Step 5 (Beneficiaries)
- For each likely beneficiary, fetch evidence via `deduce_roles()`
- Regex fallback: search for first name in the recent text, grab ~80 char window
- Display each candidate with: `📨 _from message:_ "<snippet>"`

### Address-to-Asset Matching (Step 6 prep)
WhatsApp text + property images are interrelated. Addresses MUST be deduced.
- `_extract_whatsapp_context_for_file()` — find adjacent text per filename
- `ai_match_property_addresses()` — Claude AI matches addresses → docs across the whole text
- `_persist_property_enrichment()` — runs on chat turns AND on email receipt
- Property card shows: ✅ high / 🟡 medium / 🔴 low confidence
- Low/medium asks user to confirm before accepting

---

## 10. UI/UX Rules

### Markdown formatting
- Section headings: `### 👤 Step 1: Identity (N left)` — emoji + step number + title
- Quick-reply buttons via `<!--quickreplies:[{"label":"...","value":"..."}]-->` marker

### Button styling (frontend `chat.js`)
- `skip` / `not yet` → muted gray
- `delete` → red
- everything else → primary blue

### AI Summary card — NEVER include exhibit thumbnails
The intake card already shows exhibits. The summary message uses
`attachments_json='[]'` so thumbnails aren't repeated.

### Walkthrough cards
- Show ONLY the focused IC/property/asset (one at a time)
- Show evidence/snippets from the user's own words when suggesting
- Confidence indicators on AI-deduced fields (✅ 🟡 🔴)

---

## 11. Things NOT To Do

These are direct quotes / paraphrases of user feedback. Do not repeat these mistakes.

- ❌ Saying **"tested"** without actually sending an email
- ❌ Saying **"deployed"** after `docker compose restart` (image not rebuilt)
- ❌ Adding `inbox.` prefix back to the email address
- ❌ Putting **Executor / Witness** in the Step 1 Identity buttons
- ❌ Showing **exhibit thumbnails** in the AI Summary card
- ❌ Buttons that **render but do nothing** when clicked
- ❌ Asking about ICs / data the wizard **already knows**
- ❌ Skipping the **address-to-asset matching** during property review
- ❌ Suggesting Executor/Beneficiary **without** showing the text evidence
- ❌ Bypassing the test pipeline — every deploy ends with a real email test
